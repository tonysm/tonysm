Hey, there! 👋

I'm a programmer from 🇧🇷 Brazil. I'm a Full Stack programmer at [Tighten](https://tighten.com/) (previously [Worksite Safety](https://worksitesafety.ca/), and before that [madewithlove](https://madewithlove.com/)). I'm also currently working on [Turbo Laravel](https://github.com/tonysm/turbo-laravel), [Rich Text Laravel](https://github.com/tonysm/rich-text-laravel), [Importmap Laravel](https://github.com/tonysm/importmap-laravel), [TailwindCSS Laravel](https://github.com/tonysm/tailwindcss-laravel), and other libs.

My personal goals are to bridge the Rails and Laravel worlds and also to try to reduce the JavaScript footprint needed to build modern Laravel applications.
